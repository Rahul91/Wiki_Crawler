It crwals through the first link of any wiki page untill it finds the Philosophy page.\r\n\r\nThe program is really very simple and interesting, not to forget that the most important thing in the program is to have an terminatig condiotion, without which it might keeps on crawling, wasitng memory space and time.\r\n \r\nIn my case, I have chosen the no. of links visited the terminating condition:\r\n        \r\n        if (i==100):\t\t\t\t#Quits if the link count reaches 100\r\n        \tprint \"Quitting\"\r\n        \tsys.exit(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program takes, a string as input i.e. first wiki page you intend to start your search from, then it keeps on crawling untill it finds the safe heaven i.e. Philosophy wiki page.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso do visit the link below, it graphically and beautifully shows how, Philosophy can be reached from any node(Article).\r\n Link : http://www.xefer.com/wikipedia \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
